# Extreme heat

ERA5 Climatology
- 0.5 degree grid netCDF, 1991-2020
- days with heat index >35 degrees - where heat index is derived from temperature and specific humidity, most relevant for human experience of heat
- number of hot days (Tmax > 35°C)
- number of hot days (Tmax > 40°C)

### Rail temperature and likelihood of buckling

from Supplemental Information on Rail Analysis Methods, Figure 2.1. Relationship of Buckling Probability to Air Temperature

probability of buckling = 5.72484819653954E-10 exp(0.429053122918145 x)

Approximately:

pb,temp°C
0.0,34
0.1,44
0.2,46
0.5,48
0.8,49
1.0,49.5


### Roads high temperature days and increased softness

- "correlation between temperature increase and rutting"
- "in a year in which the average temperature increases by 5% (a climate stressor measure that is consistent with the underlying literature), there will be an additional 0.04 inches (1.016mm) of rutting"
- "IRI (international roughness index, smoothness in cm/km) = 57.56 x RD (rut depth, mm) − 334"
- "one unit change in IRI leads to a 0.48-km/h change in free-flow speed"

- 5% increase in Neumann 2021 above is taken from an average change of 2.63333°F i.e. 1.5°C (1.46298518518)

- "Theoretically, well maintained track should not be vulnerable to buckling up to ambient temperatures of ~39.3°C"
- "the majority of severe events occur over 27°C in London and the South-East, suggesting that track is of poorer condition"
